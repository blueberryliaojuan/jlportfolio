            <p className="heading3 mb-4">
              Cooking has taught me invaluable lessons about balance, precision,
              and artistry. In the kitchen, Iâ€™ve learned to understand flavors,
              blend them harmoniously, and create dishes that are as visually
              appealing as they are delicious. Itâ€™s also an excellent way to
              sharpen skills like time management, organization, and empathy by
              understanding the tastes and preferences of others. My favorite
              part of cooking is the presentationâ€”turning a meal into a work of
              art.
            </p>
            <p className="heading3 mb-4">
              During holidays, I love hiking with friends. Exploring nature
              challenges my physical limits, provides a sense of accomplishment,
              and keeps me energized. I always carry my tripod and camera to
              capture breathtaking views along the way. Sharing these moments
              with friends strengthens our bonds, and many of the photos I take
              inspire or directly feature in my design projects.
