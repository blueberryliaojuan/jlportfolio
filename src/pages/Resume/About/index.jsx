            Beyond my passion for web design and development, I find immense joy
            in two hobbies that deeply influence my perspective and
            creativity:Â cookingÂ andÂ hiking.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Cooking has taught me invaluable lessons about balance, precision,
            and artistry. In the kitchen, Iâ€™ve learned to understand flavors,
            blend them harmoniously, and create dishes that are as visually
            appealing as they are delicious. Itâ€™s also an excellent way to
            sharpen skills like time management, organization, and empathy by
            understanding the tastes and preferences of others. My favorite part
            of cooking is the presentationâ€”turning a meal into a work of art.
          </p>
          <p>
            During holidays, I love hiking with friends. Exploring nature
            challenges my physical limits, provides a sense of accomplishment,
            and keeps me energized. I always carry my tripod and camera to
            capture breathtaking views along the way. Sharing these moments with
            friends strengthens our bonds, and many of the photos I take inspire
            or directly feature in my design projects.
